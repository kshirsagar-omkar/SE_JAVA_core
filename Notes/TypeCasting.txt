	float f = 3.14;				//Error Data Loose
	->
		float f = 3.14f;

	Type Casting

		double --> int 			//Error 	Data Loose
		double --> float		//Error 	Data Loose

	There Are Two Types of Type Casting

	1) Automatically Done by Compiler/Interpriter is called as implicit Type Casting
	->
		int --> float 				//No Data Loose

	2) Done by Devloper is called as Explicit Type Casting
	->
		int <-- int(3.14)
	


	*AutoBoxing
	->
		When int is assigned to object
		Intiger obj = 11;				// Data Types --> Class Types
	
	
	*Unboxing
	->
		When Object is Assigned to Data Type

		Intiger obj(11);
		int i = obj;

		obj madhla thoda part ghenar ani to int i madhe thevnar

		Class Types --> Data Types
